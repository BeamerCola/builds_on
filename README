Gives you a [name]_attributes= setter method to create nested objects via params.

Example:

== contact.rb
builds_on :emails, :field_to_be_skipped_if_blank => "address"

== contacts/_form.html.erb
<%= text_field_tag "contact[email_attributes][][address]" %>

Options:
* +name+ - Name of association in singular form.  I.E. address, email, etc.
* +field_to_be_skipped_if_blank+ - If field is left blank, it will remove it from the
attributes before inserting.

* +destroy_associations+ - Will destroy all existing associated objects before insert.
